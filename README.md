A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool used to estimate an individual's body fat based on their weight and height. It's a simple mathematical formula that provides a numerical value representing a person's body composition in relation to their height.
The BMI formula divides an individual's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. The result categorizes the individual into different weight status categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

While BMI is a useful screening tool, it doesn't directly measure body fat percentage or health. Other factors like muscle mass, bone density, and distribution of fat play a role in overall health. Therefore, it's important to interpret BMI results alongside other health indicators for a comprehensive understanding of one's health status.
